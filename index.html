            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Search "folds" character families, matching similar-looking letters
                across alphabets, to match foreign terms. So, you don't have to type in diacritical letters, and your
                terms will still match. For example, Citroen will match Citroën, and Aeroskobing matches Ærøskøbing.

                Characters that are not numbers or letters (punctuation marks, brackets and slashes, math and other
                symbols) are generally ignored. For example, Credit (finance) will return articles with the words credit
                and finance, ignoring the parentheses, unless an article with exact title Credit (finance) exists.
                Similarly, a search for the string |LT| (letters LT between two pipe symbols) will only return articles
                with lt. In order to search for terms that contain non-alphanumeric characters, a regex search must be
                used instead (using the \ escape character if required), for example insource:/\|LT\|/ will successfully
                return all instances of |LT|.

                The source text is what is searched, which is not always what is displayed on the screen. This
                distinction is relevant for piped links, for interlanguage links (to find links to Chinese articles,
                search for zh, not for Zhongwen), special characters (if ê is coded as &ecirc; it is found searching for
                ecirc), etc.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Transforming Education in India</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a 'concurrent subject'. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28
                states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the
                policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast. Periodically, national
                policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and policies.
                State governments and local government bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary schools
                and the number of government-managed elementary schools is growing. Simultaneously the number and
                proportion managed by private bodies is growing. In 2005-6 83.13% of schools offering elementary
                education (Grades 1–8) were managed by government and 16.86% of schools were under private management
                (excluding children in unrecognised schools, schools established under the Education Guarantee Scheme
                and in alternative learning centers). Of those schools managed privately, one third are 'aided' and two
                thirds are 'unaided'. Enrolment in Grades 1–8 is shared between government and privately managed schools
                in the ratio 73:27. However in rural areas this ratio is higher (80:20) and in urban areas much lower
                (36:66).[7]

                In the 2011 Census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for males and 65% for females.
                National Statistical Commission surveyed literacy to be 77.7% in 2017–18, 84.7% for male and 70.3% for
                female.[8] This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were
                18%, 27% and 9%.[9] India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to
                its economic development.[10][11] Much of the progress, especially in higher education and scientific
                research, has been credited to various public institutions. While enrolment in higher education has
                increased steadily over the past decade, reaching a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of 26.3% in 2019,[12]
                there still remains a significant distance to catch up with tertiary education enrolment levels of
                developed nations,[13] a challenge that will be necessary to overcome in order to continue to reap a
                demographic dividend from India's comparatively young population.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Let's Build a World Together contains more songs celebrating the fairy tale
                romance of country music's royal couple featuring producer Billy Sherrill's Phil Spector-influenced
                production. Regardless of what the reality may have been, country fans couldn't get enough of the pair
                who appeared to be living every word they sang. As Eugene Chadbourne of AllMusic astutely observes, "The
                chemistry that develops between partners in a male and female country music duo can sometimes be based
                on fantasy, as was obviously the case with Loretta Lynn and Ernest Tubb, who no country listener even
                imagined for a moment were romantically involved. Tammy Wynette and George Jones, on the other hand, did
                have a relationship." The truth was not as idyllic as their fans preferred to imagine it. Years later,
                in the documentary Stand By Your Dream, Wynette recalled, "It was very difficult on us, both of us being
                in the business and both of us being together twenty-four hours a day. We were constantly together. We
                never had any breathing room, no space...And Jones had a very bad drinking problem, and I knew that when
                we married but, you know, you always think, 'Oh shoot, he'll be so happy when he marries me and that'll
                all stop.' You think you can change somebody but you never can. And it wasn't all his fault...I nagged
                him about his drinkin' an awful lot because he has cirrhosis of the liver and the doctors told him that
                it was gonna kill him if he did not quit drinkin'. Well, you can't sit by and watch someone you love
                totally destroy themselves and not try and do something. Maybe I did it in the wrong way but it was the
                only way I knew to do it at the time."</p>
